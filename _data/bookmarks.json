Every piece of business that happens on their platforms, is to their credit. And developers are lucky to be able to pay them almost a third of their revenue for the privilege of being on their platforms. If Apple understands that their relationship with developers is reciprocal, they’re hiding it well.\nI like all my Apple hardware. Heck, I even love some of it! I also like the operating systems, the general focus on privacy, and the way the different parts of the ecosystem work together. But I think I could enjoy a Framework laptop, Asus phone and some Sony earbuds as well! The things Apple makes and does isn’t the main reason I keep buying Apple products. It’s all the fantastic third-party developers, mostly indie, who make great software for the Apple platforms.",

    "description": "Over the last week I’ve had a lot of fun building a little retro-themed\nwebsite that I’m hosting at home. Inspired by Ruben’s Retro Corner\nI’ve been meaning to do this for a while, and actually started on it in June\nlast year. More recently Joel Humphries shared on The Sizzle forum that he’d\nbuilt a little site that he was hosting at home on a Raspberry Pi. This\nreignited my interest in getting my own site up again. For the fun of it I\ndecided to implement it in HTML4 and serve it over plain HTTP so that it\nwould work on old computers.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n    \n  \n  \n  The site in IE 4.01 on Mac OS 8.1\n",
