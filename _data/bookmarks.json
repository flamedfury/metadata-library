    "description": "When I first used the Internet, way back in the mid-90s, it wasn’t really a thing people thought about. It wasn’t a big deal, because most people didn’t even have it. If you wanted to use the Internet, if you even had a reason to do so, you had to go somewhere else to do it. The library or your school. It wasn’t until 2001 or 2002 that I finally got dial up at my house. And I know that my experiences there aren’t all that unusual. You can look up the stats if you want, but the saturation of Internet in private households didn’t take off until the mid-00s.\n",

    "description": "The way we consume content on the internet is increasingly driven by walled-garden platforms and black-box feed algorithms. This shift is making our media diets miserable. Ironically, a solution to the problem predates algorithmic feeds, social media and other forms of informational junk food. It is called RSS (Really Simple Syndication) and it is beautiful.\nWhat the hell is RSS? RSS is just a format that defines how websites can publish updates (articles, posts, episodes, and so on) in a standard feed that you can subscribe to using an RSS reader (or aggregator). Don’t worry if this sounds extremely uninteresting to you; there aren’t many people that get excited about format specifications; the beauty of RSS is in its simplicity. Any content management system or blog platform supports RSS out of the box, and often enables it by default. As a result, a large portion of the content on the internet is available to you in feeds that you can tap into. But this time, you’re in full control of what you’re receiving, and the feeds are purely reverse chronological bliss. Coincidentally, you might already be using RSS without even knowing, because the whole podcasting world runs on RSS.",
